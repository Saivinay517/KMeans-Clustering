## Project Title:
Analysis and Prediciton of **"small_customers.csv"** of American Mall Markets called as Phonix Mall to find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop. on the basis of this prediction of annual income Verses spending scores.
## Disclaimer:
In this particular dataset we assume annual income as a centroid and spending scores from the range 1 to 100 called as datanode of the cluster.
## Problem Statement:
The American Finance Market as per the GDP of 2011 'Phonix_Trilliums Mall' as in the first range out of 5. The onwer of the mall wants to be exact which particular shop or product such in different kinds of clusters in entire mall.
As the Data Science Engineer predict the futuristic financial market for upcomming GDP rate based on No.of cluster.
The client wants atleast 5 clusters[shops].

## Conclusion:
According to model basis prediction using Machine Learning algorithm KMeans Clustering we found that Cluster-1 which consists Red color is the highest cluster which attach more than 50 Datanodes.
## references:
The model building algorithm develop for all kinds of clusteration values. The yellow spots represents "Centroids" which is max to max only 3.
